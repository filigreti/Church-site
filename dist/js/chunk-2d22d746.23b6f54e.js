Just before his 14th birthday on 5th of June, 1975, he attended a crusade in the city of Kano where Evangelist J. K. Solomon preached the gospel and demonstrated the supernatural; the cripple walked, the blind saw, the deaf heard and many more. When the evangelist gave an altar call, Sunday gave his heart to the Lord at this teenage age. After this encounter with The Lord, He never looked back. He began to fast and seek the Lord five days in a week. He also joined the new church that was planted after the crusade. He received sound teachings from this new church and his passion to see souls saved through the preaching of the gospel and sick healed increased daily. After his secondary school education, he left the far north of Nigeria for the Middle belt region for his higher learning where he practically lunched into full soul winning ventures. As a student, he held crusades from one village to another, miracle services and prayer conferences and traveled to different places to preach. This drew hundreds initially, but now several thousands have been impacted around the world. Today, He has taken the gospel of Jesus Christ to five continents of the world except Australia. Tens of thousands of sinners have been saved, the sick healed and several testimonies of the dead being raised back to life. By the mercies for God, his ministry has witnessed all kinds of miracles you can imagine ")])])])},function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,s=e._self._c||t;return s("div",{staticClass:"max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-1 lg:px-0 px-5"},[s("p",{staticClass:"text-gray-800 text-xs font-light tracking-wider leading-6"},[e._v(" He has a ceaseless passion for lost souls.
